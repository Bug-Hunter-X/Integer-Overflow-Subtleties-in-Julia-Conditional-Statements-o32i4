# Integer Overflow Subtleties in Julia
This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to integer overflow in Julia's conditional statements. The bug may not always be apparent, especially when dealing with potentially large numbers.

The issue occurs when intermediate calculations within a conditional statement exceed Julia's integer limits. This can lead to unexpected behavior and incorrect results.

**Example:** The `bug.jl` file contains a function which exhibits this behavior under certain conditions.  The `bugSolution.jl` file shows a possible mitigation approach.

Feel free to contribute to the discussion and suggest better solutions.
